Task: Build a Simple RESTful API

Description: You are required to create a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API will manage a collection of books. Each book should have the following properties:


id: A unique identifier (UUID or auto-incremented integer).

title: The title of the book (string).

author: The author of the book (string).

publishedDate: The published date of the book (date).

pages: The number of pages in the book (integer).

Requirements:

GET /books:

Retrieve a list of all books.

Response should include all the books in JSON format.

GET /books/:

Retrieve a single book by its id.

Return a 404 error if the book is not found.

POST /books:

Add a new book.

The request body should contain the title, author, publishedDate, and pages of the book.

Return the newly created book in the response.

PUT /books/:

Update the details of a book by its id.

The request body should allow updating any of the book's properties (title, author, publishedDate, pages).

Return the updated book in the response.

Return a 404 error if the book is not found.

DELETE /books/: 

Delete a book by its id.

Return a 204 status code if the deletion is successful.

Return a 404 error if the book is not found.

Error Handling:

Proper error handling for invalid routes or HTTP methods.

Return appropriate status codes and error messages for different scenarios.

Bonus Points:

Use a simple in-memory data store (an array) to hold the books.

Implement input validation using a library like Joi or express-validator.

Write basic unit tests for the API endpoints using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

Example Endpoints:

GET /books should return a list of books.

GET /books/1 should return a specific book with ID 1.

POST /books should allow adding a new book.

PUT /books/1 should allow updating the book with ID 1.

DELETE /books/1 should delete the book with ID 1.
